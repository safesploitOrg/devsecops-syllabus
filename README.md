# DevSecOps Syllabus — Secure Platform Engineering

This repository documents a **structured DevSecOps self-study syllabus** designed to transition from senior infrastructure operations into **secure platform and DevSecOps engineering**.

The focus is on **real-world implementation**, **secure-by-design systems**, and **operational realism** — not certifications, tool-chasing, or theoretical exercises.

This syllabus reflects how DevSecOps works in practice:  
across infrastructure, pipelines, identity, monitoring, and incident response, with security treated as a **continuous system responsibility**.

## What This Is

This repository is:

- A deliberately designed **DevSecOps syllabus**, structured into clear modules  
- Grounded in **production infrastructure and security experience**  
- Focused on **automation, auditability, and failure modes**  
- Aligned with real frameworks such as **NIST**, **Cyber Essentials+**, and **NHS Digital**  
- Backed by **hands-on projects** implemented in homelab and cloud environments  

The structure is intended to be **followable by others**, while remaining honest about trade-offs and complexity.

## What This Is Not

This repository is **not**:

- A beginner tutorial or bootcamp  
- A certification cram guide  
- A collection of untested notes or copy-pasted commands  
- A “DevSecOps tools list”  

If you’re looking for quick wins or surface-level coverage, this repo is not for you.

## Syllabus Structure

The syllabus is organised into **module-based directories**, each representing a core DevSecOps responsibility domain.

At a high level:

- **Modules 01–03** establish DevSecOps, DevOps, and security foundations  
- **Modules 04–06** focus on platforms, pipelines, and infrastructure security  
- **Modules 07–10** address compliance, threat modelling, containers, and incident response  
- **Modules 11–13** focus on professional practice, hands-on projects, and portfolio positioning  

Each module contains its own `README.md` outlining scope, intent, and key topics.

## Practical Projects

Hands-on implementation lives in two places:

- `module-12-practical-projects/` — projects directly tied to syllabus modules  
- `projects/` — standalone, end-to-end implementations demonstrating secure platform design  

Projects prioritise:
- Secure defaults  
- Explicit trust boundaries  
- Automation and repeatability  
- Observability and failure handling  

Perfection is not the goal — **clarity of thinking is**.

## Intended Audience

This repository is aimed at:

- Infrastructure / System engineers moving toward **DevSecOps or Platform roles**  
- DevOps engineers looking to deepen **security and operational maturity**  
- Security engineers seeking stronger **infrastructure and delivery context**  

It assumes familiarity with Linux, networking, and basic automation concepts.

## Status

This repository is actively developed and expanded over time.  
Content is added iteratively as modules and projects are completed or refined.

The structure is intentional and stable; depth evolves as understanding deepens.
